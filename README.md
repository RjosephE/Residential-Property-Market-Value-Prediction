## Context

Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States (U.S.). According to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau, 1,603,797 people were residing in the city . As a city which has shifted from a shrinking city to a growing one with an increased demand for housing, residents of Philadelphia are finding it increasingly difficult to find and secure affordable housing . In 2018, 40% of Philadelphia households are cost-burdened because they spent at least 30% of their income on housing costs. The housing crisis in Philadelphia is worsened by the high poverty rate of the city causing low income communities to be the most severely impacted . Renters with incomes below USD30,000 per year are severely cost-burdened because they spend at least 50% of their income on housing . Thus, these conditions show that houses are overpriced for a large group of households who live with a low income.


## Problem Statement
